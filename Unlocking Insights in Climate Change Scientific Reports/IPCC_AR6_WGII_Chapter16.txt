Figure 16.1 | Illustrative storyline of the chapter highlighting the central questions addressed in the various sections, from realised risks (observed impacts)
to future risks (key risks and reasons for concern), informed by adaptation-related responses and the limits to adaptation. The arrows illustrate actions to reduce
hazard, exposure and vulnerability, which shape risks over time. Accordingly, the green areas at the centre of the propeller diagrams indicate the ability for such solutions to reduce
risk, up to certain adaptation limits, leaving the white residual risk (or observed impacts) in the centre. The shading of the right-hand-side propeller diagram compared with the
non-shaded one on the left reflects some degree of uncertainty about future risks. The figure builds on the conceptual framework of risk–adaptation relationships used in SROCC

   Box 16.1: Case Study on Climate Change and the Outbreak of the Syrian Civil War

   Separating between climatic and non-climatic factors in impact attribution is often challenging, as highlighted by the debate surrounding
   the causes of the Syrian civil war. During the years 2006–2010, the Fertile Crescent region in Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia
   was hit by the worst drought on meteorological record, compounding a consistent drying of the region over the past half century (Trigo
   et al., 2010; Hoerling et al., 2012; Mathbout et al., 2018, SR15 BOX 3.2 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018a)). The magnitude of the multi-year
   drought is estimated to have become two to three times more likely as a result of increased CO2 forcing (Kelley et al., 2015). The drought
   had a devastating impact on agricultural production in the northeast of Syria. In 2007–2008 alone, average crop yields dropped by 32%
   in irrigated areas and as much as 79% in rain-fed areas (De Châtel, 2014), and herders in the northeast lost around 85% of their livestock
   (Werrell et al., 2015). Successive years with little or no income eventually forced people to leave their farms in great numbers and seek
   employment in less affected parts of the country, adding to existing pressures on housing, labour market and public goods provision
   (Gleick, 2014; Kelley et al., 2015). In March 2011, by which time the ‘Arab Spring’ uprisings had gained momentum and spread across much
   of the region, anti-regime protests broke out in Syria, first in the southern city of Dara’a and then in Damascus and throughout the country.
                                                                                                                                                     16
   Yet, the attribution of the Syrian civil war to climate change has triggered a heated debate. A number of studies argue that the principal
   drivers of the drought-induced economic collapse were political rather than environmental in nature, shaped by adverse economic
   reforms and unsustainable agricultural policies, promoting water-intensive irrigation schemes for cotton cultivation and implementing
   abrupt subsidy cuts at the peak of the drought, implying that many poor farmers no longer could afford fertilis ers or fuel to power
   irrigation pumps (Barnes, 2009; De Châtel, 2014; Eklund and Thompson, 2017; Selby et al., 2017). Thus, the 2006–2010 drought did not
   precipitate similar devastating socioeconomic impacts on agrarian communities across the borders in Turkey, Iraq or Jordan, although
   environmental conditions were comparable (Trigo et al., 2010; Eklund and Thompson, 2017; Feitelson and Tubi, 2017).

   However, the relevant attribution question is not whether the same drought would produce the same consequences under different
   political and socioeconomic conditions, but rather, given the same political and socioeconomic context, how would the outcomes have
   differed in the absence of climate change? Research still provides very limited insights into whether and how the escalation process
   would have evolved differently in a counterfactual no-climate-change world.

   Thus, the role of the drought in augmenting pre-existing internal migration, and the role of the distress migration in accentuating
   demographic, economic and social pressures in receiving areas, remain contested. Estimates of the number of people who abandoned
   their farms in response to the drought range from less than 40,000–60,000 families (Selby et al., 2017) to more than 1.5 million displaced
   (Gleick, 2014). However, the numbers have to be seen in the context of prevailing population growth, significant rural–urban migration,
   and the preceding inflow of around 1.5 million refugees from neighbouring Iraq (De Châtel, 2014; Hoffmann, 2016). In addition, research
   suggests that the migrants played a peripheral role in the initial social mobilisation in March 2011 (Fröhlich, 2016).

   While it is undisputed that the drought caused direct economic losses, its overall additional impact on the Syrian economy, relative to
   other prevalent drivers of economic misery, including rampant unemployment, increasing inequalities, declining rural productivity, and
   loss of oil revenues (Aïta, 2009; Landis, 2012; De Châtel, 2014; Selby, 2019), has not been quantified.

   In addition, the protesters’ demands centred around contentious political rather than economic issues, including release of political
   prisoners, ending of torture and indiscriminate violence by security forces, and abolishment of the near 50-year-old state of emergency
   (Selby et al., 2017; Ash and Obradovich, 2020). The mobilisation in Syria in the spring of 2011 also made explicit references to events
   across the Middle East and North African region. Analyses of regional and social media and networks show a high level of interaction
   across the Arab world, and the initial Syrian uprising adopted a mobilisation model and rhetorical frames similar to those developed in
   Tunisia and Egypt (Leenders, 2013; 2014). However, the Syrian uprising stands out in how it was met with overwhelming violent force by
   the police and security forces, which changed the character of the resistance and opened up for militarisation of non-state actors that
   further escalated the conflict (Heydemann, 2013; Leenders, 2013; Bramsen, 2020).

   In summary, the drought itself is shown to be attributable to GHG emissions. The agricultural losses and internal migration from rural to
   urban areas can be directly linked to the drought and in this way are partly attributable to GHG emissions, although there are no studies
   comparing the observed losses and number of people displaced with a counterfactual situation of a weaker drought in a ‘no climate
   change’ situation. Current research does not provide enough evidence to attribute the civil war to climate change. In contrast, it is likely
   that social uprisings would have occurred even without the drought.

We use the term ‘adaptation-related responses’, recognising                    widespread and extensive observed changes in organisms (genetics,

    Introduction
    Our world today is characterised by a high degree of interconnectedness and globalisation which establish pathways for the transmission
    of climate-related risks across sectors and borders (high confidence) (Challinor et al., 2018; Hedlund et al., 2018). While the IPCC 5th
    Assessment Report (AR5) has pointed to this connection of risks across regions as ‘cross-regional phenomena’ (Hewitson et al., 2014),
    only a few countries so far have integrated inter-regional aspects into their climate change risks assessments (Liverman, 2016; Surminski
    et al., 2016; Adams et al., 2020), and adaptation is still framed as a predominantly national or local issue (Dzebo and Stripple, 2015;
    Benzie and Persson, 2019).

    Inter-regional risks from climate change—also called cross-border, transboundary, transnational or indirect risks—are risks that are
    transmitted across borders (e.g., transboundary water use) and/or via teleconnections (e.g., supply chains, global food markets) (Moser
    and Hart, 2015). The risks can result from impacts, including compound or concurrent impacts, that cascade across several tiers, in ways
    that either diminish or escalate risk within international systems (Carter et al., 2021). Risk transmission may occur through trade and
    finance networks, flows of people (Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7), biophysical flows (natural resources such as water) and
    ecosystem connections. However, not only risks are transmitted across borders and systems; the adaptation response may also reduce
    risks at the origin of the risk, along the transmission channel or at the recipient of the risk (Carter et al., 2021). This cross-chapter box
    discusses four inter-regional risk channels (trade, finance, food and ecosystems) and how adaptation can govern these risks.

    Trade
    Most commodities are traded on global markets, and supply chains have become increasingly globalised. For instance, specialised industrial
    commodities such as semiconductors are geographically concentrated in a few countries (Challinor et al., 2017; Liverman, 2016). When
    climatic events like flooding or heat affect the location of these extraction and production activities, economies are not only disrupted
    locally but also across borders and in distant countries (high confidence), as exemplified by the Thailand flood 2011 that led to a shortage
    of key inputs to the automotive and electronics industry not only in Thailand but also in Japan, Europe and the USA (Figure Cross-Chapter
    Box INTEREG.1). For many industrialised countries like the UK, Japan, the USA and the European Union, there is increasing evidence that
    the trade impacts of climate change are significant and can have substantial domestic impacts (medium confidence) (Nakano, 2017; Willner
    et al., 2018, Section 13.9.1; Benzie and Persson, 2019; Knittel et al., 2020). Enhanced trade can transmit risks across borders and thereby
    amplify damages (Wenz and Levermann, 2016), but it can also increase resilience (Lim-Camacho et al., 2017; Willner et al., 2018).

        to a factor of 10 for countries that are central financial hubs (Mandel et al., 2021, Figure 13.28). Indirect impacts may also arise through
        indirect effects on foreign direct investment, remittance flows and official development assistance (Hedlund et al., 2018).

   Food
   The global supply of agricultural products is concentrated to a few main breadbaskets (Bren d’Amour et al., 2016; Gaupp et al., 2020,
   Chapter 5). For instance, Central and South America is one of the regions with the highest potential to increase food supplies to more
   densely populated regions in Asia, the Middle East and Europe (Chapter 12). The exports of agricultural commodities (coffee, bananas,
   sugar, soybean, corn, sugarcane, beef livestock) have gained importance in the past two decades as international trade and globalisation
   of markets have shaped the global agri-food system (Chapter 5).

   The export of major food crops like wheat, maize and soybeans from many of the world’s water-scarce area—the Middle East, North Africa,
   parts of South Asia, North China Plains, southwest USA, Australia—to relatively water-abundant parts of the world carries a high virtual
   water content (the net volume of water embedded in trade) (high confidence) (Hoekstra and Mekonnen, 2012; Dalin et al., 2017; Zhao
   et al., 2019, Chapter 4). Both importing and exporting countries are exposed to transboundary risk transmission through climate change
   impacts on distant water resources (Sartori et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Ercin et al., 2021). Climate change is projected to exacerbate         16
   risk and add new vulnerabilities for risk transmission (medium confidence). Rising atmospheric CO2 concentration is projected to decrease
   water efficiency of growing maize and temperate cereal crops in parts of the USA, East and Mediterranean Europe, South Africa, Argentina,
   Australia and Southeast Asia, with important implications for future trade in food grains (Fader et al., 2010). By 2050 (SRES B2 scenario),
   virtual water importing countries in Africa and the Middle East may be exposed to imported water stress as they rely on imports of food
   grains from countries which have unsustainable water use (Sartori et al., 2017). Until 2100, virtual trade in irrigation water is projected
   to almost triple (for SSP2-RCP6.5 scenarios) and the direction of virtual water flows is projected to reverse, with the currently exporting
   regions like South Asia becoming importers of virtual water (Graham et al., 2020). An additional 10–120% trade flow from water-abundant
   regions to water-scarce regions will be needed to sustain environmental flow requirements on a global scale by the end of the century
   (Pastor et al., 2019). Exports of agricultural commodities contribute to deforestation, over-exploitation of natural resources and pollution,
   affecting the natural capital base and ecosystem services (Agarwala and Coyle, 2020; Rabin et al., 2020, Section 12.5.4).

   Species and ecosystems
   The spatial distributions of species on land and in the oceans are shifting due to climate change, with these changes projected to
   accelerate at higher levels of global warming (Pecl et al., 2017). These ‘species on the move’ have large effects on ecosystems and human
   well-being, and present challenges for governance (Pecl et al., 2017). For example, the number of transboundary fish stocks is projected to
   increase as key fisheries species are displaced by ocean warming (Pinsky et al., 2018). Conflict over shifting mackerel fisheries has already
   occurred between European countries (Spijkers and Boonstra, 2017), because few regulatory bodies have clear policies on shifting stocks;
   this leaves species open to unsustainable exploitation in new waters in the absence of regularly updated catch allocations to reflect
   changing stock distributions (Caddell, 2018).

   Human health will also be affected as vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue shift geographic distributions (Caminade et al.,
   2014). There is also evidence that many warm-adapted invasive species, such as invasive freshwater cyanobacterium, have spread to
   higher latitudes because of climate change (Chapter 2).

   Adaptation to inter-regional climate risks
   Adaptation responses to reduce inter-regional risks can be implemented at a range of scales: at the point of the initial climate change
   impact (e.g., assistance for recovery after an extreme event, development of resilient infrastructure, climate-smart technologies for
   agriculture); at or along the pathway via which impacts are transmitted to the eventual recipient (e.g., trade diversification, re-routing
   of transport); in the recipient country (e.g., increasing storage to buffer supply disruptions), or by third parties (e.g., adaptation finance,
   technology transfer) (Bren d’Amour et al., 2016; Carter et al., 2021; Talebian et al., 2021). A knowledge gap exits on the need for,
   effectiveness of, and limits to adaptation under different socioeconomic and land use futures.

   Due to regional and global interdependencies, climate resilience has a global, multi-level public good character (Banda, 2018). The
   benefits of adaptation are therefore shared beyond the places where adaptation is initially implemented. Conversely, adaptation may
   be successful at a local level while redistributing vulnerability elsewhere or even driving or exacerbating risks in other places (Atteridge
   and Remling, 2018). International cooperation is therefore needed to ensure that inter-regional effects are considered in adaptation and
   that adaptation efforts are coordinated to avoid maladaptation. However, regional- and global-scale governance of adaptation is only
   just beginning to emerge (Persson, 2019).

   The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement frames adaptation as a ‘global challenge’
   (Article 7.2) and establishes the global goal on adaptation (Article 7.1), which provides space for dialogue between parties on the

         global-scale challenge of adaptation and the need for renewed political and financial investment in adaptation, including to address
         inter-regional effects (Benzie et al., 2018).

         National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) can evolve to consider inter-regional effects as well as domestic ones (Liverman, 2016; Surminski et al.,
         2016; European Environment, 2020). Regional and international coordination of NAPs, coupled with building capacities and addressing
         existing knowledge gaps at the country level, can help to ensure that resources are oriented towards reducing inter-regional risks and
         building systemic resilience to climate change globally (Booth et al., 2020; Wijenayake et al., 2020).

         Given the important role of private actors in managing inter-regional climate risks (Goldstein et al., 2019; Tenggren et al., 2019), efforts
         will be needed to align public and private strategies for managing inter-regional climate risks to avoid maladaptation and ensure just and
         equitable adaptation at different scales (Talebian et al., 2021).

    Box 16.2 | Linking Adaptation Constraints, Soft and Hard Limits

    McNamara et al. (2017) provides an example of community-scaled adaptation that highlights how constraints affect limits, the relationship
    between soft and hard limits, and the potential need to abandon or transform objectives. Community members of Boigu Island, Australia,
    are already adapting to perceived climate change hazards—including sea level rise and coastal erosion—to secure their objective of
    sustaining livelihoods and way of life in their current location. Existing seawall and drainage systems provide inadequate protection
    from flooding during high tides, leading residents to elevate their houses to prevent damages. However, these adaptation measures have
    proved to be insufficient. Standing saltwater for extended periods of time after floods has resulted in losses and damages, including
    erosion of infrastructure, increased soil salinity, and heightened public health concerns. Additional adaptation efforts are constrained by
    scarcity of elevated land, which inhibits movement of infrastructure within the community, and lack of financial, technical and human
    assets to improve coastal protection measures.

    These constraints are leading to a soft limit to adaptation, where risks would become unreasonable as sea levels continue to rise and
    practicable and affordable adaptation options are limited to currently available approaches. This soft limit could be overcome through
    addressing constraints and allowing further adaptation to take place, such as providing financial, technical and human resources for more
    effective coastal protection and drainage systems that would reduce flooding. However, if the effectiveness of these new adaptation
    measures decreases as sea levels rise further and if constraints are not able to be overcome, another soft limit may be reached. Eventually,
    if constraints are not addressed, no further adaptation measures are implemented, and climate hazards intensify, the area could become
    uninhabitable. This would then be a hard limit for adaptation; there would be no adaptation options available that would allow the
    community to sustain livelihoods and way of life in its present location. This hard limit to adaptation may necessitate abandoning the
    objective of remaining in the community. The objective of the community may then transform to sustaining their livelihoods in a less
    vulnerable location, which would necessitate relocation. However, such transformation of the community’s objectives may be hindered
    by the expressed resistance of residents to migrate, due to their strong sense of place.

     Figure 16.7 | Evidence on constraints and limits to adaptation by region and sector. Data from Thomas et al. (2021), based on 1682 scientific publications reporting
     on adaptation-related responses in human systems. See SM16.1 for methods. Low evidence: <20% of assessed literature has information on limits; literature mostly focuses on
     constraints to adaptation. Medium evidence: between 20% and 40% of assessed literature has information on limits; literature provides some evidence of constraints being
     linked to limits. High evidence: >40% of assessed literature has information on limits; literature provides broad evidence of constraints being linked to limits.

Figure 16.8 | Constraints associated with limits by region and sector. Data from Thomas et al. (2021), based on 1682 scientific publications reporting on adaptation-related
responses in human systems. See SM16.1 for methods. Constraints are categorised as: (1) economic: existing livelihoods, economic structures, and economic mobility; (2) social/
cultural: social norms, identity, place attachment, beliefs, worldviews, values, awareness, education, social justice, and social support; (3) human capacity: individual, organisational,
and societal capabilities to set and achieve adaptation objectives over time including training, education, and skill development; (4) governance, institutions and policy: existing
laws, regulations, procedural requirements, governance scope, effectiveness, institutional arrangements, adaptive capacity, and absorption capacity; (5) financial: lack of financial
resources; (6) information/awareness/technology: lack of awareness or access to information or technology; (7) physical: presence of physical barriers; and (8) biologic/climatic:
temperature, precipitation, salinity, acidity, and intensity and frequency of extreme events including storms, drought, and wind. Insufficient data: there is not enough literature to
support an assessment (fewer than five studies available); Minor constraint: <20% of assessed literature identifies this constraint; Secondary constraint: 20–50% of assessed
literature identifies this constraint; Primary constraint: >50% of assessed literature identifies this constraint.

                        Financial constraints inhibit implementation of a variety of adaptation strategies including ecosystem-based adaptation (Section 9.11.4.2) and adoption of
                        drought-tolerant crops by farmers (Section 9.12.3).
                        Information constraints (including limited climate science information), governance constraints (such as communication disconnects between national, district and
       Africa
                        community levels) and human capacity constraints (limited capacities to analyse threats and impacts) are identified as negatively affecting the implementation of
                        adaptation policies (Section 9.13.1).
                        Social/cultural constraints (social status, caste and gender) also affect adaptation in contexts with deep-rooted traditions (Section 9.12.4).

                        Governance, human capacity, financial and informational constraints commonly present barriers to urban adaptation (Section 10.4.6.5).
       Asia             Economic, governance, financial and informational constraints are related to both soft and hard limits to adaptation against a range of hazards in South Asia (Box 10.7),
                        while in West Asia, physical constraints to heatwaves and drought have been associated with limits to adaptation (Box 10.7).

                        A range of constraints, including governance, information and awareness, social/cultural, human capacity and financial, have been identified as impeding adaptation

                        Key constraints are identified as technical, biophysical, economic and social (Section 13.6.2.4).
                        For cities, settlements and key infrastructure, technical socioeconomic and environmental and regulatory constraints may lead to limits at a range of spatial scales

                        Biophysical constraints may lead to limits to the ability of water saving and water efficiency measures to prevent water insecurity under high warming scenarios
                        (Section 13.2.2.2).

                        Financial, governance, information/awareness, technological, cultural and human capacity constraints are identified as affecting adaptation and leading to soft limits

     between changing CIDs and changing socio-ecological conditions.                KRs and RKRs are projected to vary with three types of determinants:
                                                                                    global average warming level, as a proxy for associated changes
     In most of the RKRs, severe risk for broadly applicable situations requires    in climate hazards (CIDs, Ranasinghe et al., 2021); socioeconomic

     many cases, it is associated with several of these conditions occurring        exposure and vulnerability conditions; and level of adaptation to

     livelihoods (RKR-D; medium confidence) or armed conflicts (RKR-H;              and adaptation scenarios are constrained by development pathways
     low confidence).                                                               (Chapter 18)—this section assesses the influence of each dimension

    Proposed solar radiation modification schemes
    This cross-working group box assesses solar radiation modification (SRM) proposals, their potential contribution to reducing or increasing
    climate risk, as well as other risks they may pose (categorised as risks from responses to climate change in the IPCC AR6 risk definition
    in 1.2.1.1), and related perception, ethics and governance questions.

    SRM refers to proposals to increase the reflection of shortwave radiation (sunlight) back to space to counteract anthropogenic warming
    and some of its harmful impacts (de Coninck et al., 2018) (Cross-Chapter Box 10; WGI Chapters 4, 5). A number of SRM options have
    been proposed, including: stratospheric aerosol interventions (SAI), marine cloud brightening (MCB), ground-based albedo modifications
    (GBAM) and ocean albedo change (OAC). Although not strictly a form of SRM, cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) has been proposed to cool the
    planet by increasing the escape of longwave thermal radiation to space and is included here for consistency with previous assessments

        (de Coninck et al., 2018). SAI is the most-researched proposal. Modelling studies show SRM could reduce surface temperatures and
        potentially ameliorate some climate change risks (with more confidence for SAI than other options), but SRM could also introduce a
        range of new risks.

        There is high agreement in the literature that for addressing climate change risks SRM cannot be the main policy response to climate
        change and is, at best, a supplement to achieving sustained net zero or net negative CO2 emission levels globally (de Coninck et al., 2018;
        MacMartin et al., 2018; Buck et al., 2020; National Academies of Sciences and Medicine, 2021b). SRM contrasts with climate change
        mitigation activities, such as emission reductions and carbon dioxide removal (CDR), as it introduces a ‘mask’ to the climate change
        problem by altering the Earth’s radiation budget, rather than attempting to address the root cause of the problem, which is the increase
        in greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. In addition, the effects of proposed SRM options would only last as long as a deployment
        is maintained—for example, requiring ca. yearly injection of aerosols in the case of SAI as the lifetime of aerosols in the stratosphere
16      is 1–3 years (Niemeier et al., 2011) or continuous spraying of sea salt in the case of MCB as the lifetime of sea salt aerosols in the
        atmosphere is only about 10 d—which contrasts with the long lifetime of CO2 and its climate effects, with global warming resulting from
        CO2 emissions likely remaining at a similar level for a hundred years or more (MacDougall et al., 2020) and long-term climate effects of
        emitted CO2 remaining for several hundreds to thousands of years (Solomon et al., 2009).

        Which scenarios?
        The choice of SRM deployment scenarios and reference scenarios is crucial in assessment of SRM risks and its effectiveness in attenuating
        climate change risks (Keith and MacMartin, 2015; Honegger et al., 2021). Most climate model simulations have used scenarios with
        highly stylised large SRM forcing to fully counteract large amounts of warming in order to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of climate
        responses to SRM (Kravitz et al., 2015; Sugiyama et al., 2018a; Tilmes et al., 2018; Krishna-Pillai et al., 2019).

        The effects of SRM fundamentally depend on a variety of choices about deployment (Sugiyama et al., 2018b), including: its position
        in the portfolio of human responses to climate change (e.g., the magnitude of SRM used against the background radiative forcing),
        governance of research and potential deployment strategies, and technical details (latitude, materials, and season, among others, see
        WGI Section 4.6.3.3). The plausibility of many SRM scenarios is highly contested, and not all scenarios are equally plausible because
        of socio-political considerations (Talberg et al., 2018b), as with, for example, CDR (Fuss et al., 2014; Fuss et al., 2018). Development of
        scenarios and their selection in assessments should reflect a diverse set of societal values with public and stakeholder inputs (Sugiyama
        et al., 2018a; Low and Honegger, 2020), as depending on the focus of a limited climate model simulation, SRM could look grossly risky
        or highly beneficial (Pereira and al., 2021).

        In the context of reaching the long-term global temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, there are different hypothetical scenarios
        of SRM deployment: early, substantial mitigation with no SRM, more limited or delayed mitigation with moderate SRM, unchecked
        emissions with total reliance on SRM, and regionally heterogeneous SRM. Each scenario presents different levels and distributions of
        SRM benefits, side effects and risks. The more intense the SRM deployment, the larger is the likelihood for the risks of side effects and
        environmental risks (e.g., Heutel et al., 2018). Regional disparities in climate hazards may result from both regionally deployed SRM
        options such as GBAM, and more globally uniform SRM such as SAI (Jones et al., 2018a; Seneviratne et al., 2018b). There is an emerging
        literature on smaller forcings of SAI to reduce global average warming, for instance, to hold global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C alongside
        ambitious conventional mitigation (Jones et al., 2018a; MacMartin et al., 2018), or bring down temperature after an overshoot (Tilmes
        et al., 2020). If emissions reductions and CDR are deemed insufficient, SRM may be seen by some as the only option left to ensure the
        achievement of the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal by 2100.

   SRM risks to human and natural systems and potential for risk reduction
   Since AR5, hundreds of climate modelling studies have simulated effects of SRM on climate hazards (Kravitz et al., 2015; Tilmes et al.,
   2018). Modelling studies have shown SRM has the potential to offset some effects of increasing GHGs on global and regional climate,
   including the increase in frequency and intensity of extremes of temperature and precipitation, melting of Arctic sea ice and mountain
   glaciers, weakening of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, changes in frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones, and decrease
   in soil moisture (WGI, Chapter 4). However, while SRM may be effective in alleviating anthropogenic climate warming either locally or
   globally, it would neither maintain the climate in its present-day state nor return the climate to a pre-industrial state (climate averaged
   over 1850–1900, see WGI Chapter 1, Box 1.2) in all regions and in all seasons even when used to fully offset the global mean warming

        (high confidence) (WGI Chapter 4). This is because the climate forcing and response to SRM options are different from the forcing and
        response to GHG increase. Because of these differences in climate forcing and response patterns, the regional and seasonal climates of a
        world with a global mean warming of 1.5°C or 2°C achieved via SRM would be different from a world with similar global mean warming
        but achieved through mitigation (MacMartin et al.., 2019). At the regional scale and seasonal time scale, there could be considerable
        residual climate change and/or overcompensating change (e.g., more cooling, wetting or drying than just what is needed to offset
        warming, drying or wetting due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions), and there is low confidence in understanding of the climate
        response to SRM at the regional scale (WGI, Chapter 4).

        SAI implemented to partially offset warming (e.g., offsetting half of global warming) may have potential to ameliorate hazards in multiple
        regions and reduce negative residual change, such as drying compared with present-day climate, that is associated with fully offsetting
        global mean warming (Irvine and Keith, 2020), but may also increase flood and drought risk in Europe compared with unmitigated
16      warming (Jones et al., 2021). Recent modelling studies suggest it is conceptually possible to meet multiple climate objectives through
        optimally designed SRM strategies (WGI, Chapter 4). Nevertheless, large uncertainties still exist for climate processes associated with
        SRM options (e.g., aerosol–cloud–radiation interaction) (WGI, Chapter 4) (Kravitz and MacMartin, 2020).

        Compared with climate hazards, many fewer studies have examined SRM risks—the potential adverse consequences to people and
        ecosystems from the combination of climate hazards, exposure and vulnerability—or the potential for SRM to reduce risk (Curry et al.,
        2014; Irvine et al., 2017). Risk analyses have often used inputs from climate models forced with stylised representations of SRM, such
        as dimming the sun. Fewer have used inputs from climate models that explicitly simulated injection of gases or aerosols into the
        atmosphere, which include more complex cloud radiative feedbacks. Most studies have used scenarios where SAI is deployed to hold
        average global temperature constant despite high emissions.

        There is low confidence and large uncertainty in projected impacts of SRM on crop yields due in part to a limited number of studies.
        Because SRM would result in only a slight reduction in CO2 concentrations relative to the emission scenario without SRM (Chapter 5,
        WGI), the CO2 fertilisation effect on plant productivity is nearly the same in emissions scenarios with and without SRM. Nevertheless,
        changes in climate due to SRM are likely to have some impacts on crop yields. A single study indicates MCB may reduce crop failure rates
        compared with climate change from a doubling of CO2 pre-industrial concentrations (Parkes et al., 2015). Models suggest SAI cooling
        would reduce crop productivity at higher latitudes compared with a scenario without SRM by reducing the growing season length,
        but benefit crop productivity in lower latitudes by reducing heat stress (Pongratz et al., 2012; Xia et al., 2014; Zhan et al., 2019). Crop
        productivity is also projected to be reduced where SAI reduces rainfall relative to the scenario without SRM, including a case where
        reduced Asian summer monsoon rainfall causes a reduction in groundnut yields (Xia et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016). SAI will increase the
        fraction of diffuse sunlight, which is projected to increase photosynthesis in forested canopy, but will reduce the direct and total available
        sunlight, which tends to reduce photosynthesis. As total sunlight is reduced, there is a net reduction in crop photosynthesis with the result
        that any benefits to crops from avoided heat stress may be offset by reduced photosynthesis, as indicated by a single statistical modelling
        study (Proctor et al., 2018). SAI would reduce average surface ozone concentration (Xia et al., 2017) mainly as a result of aerosol-induced
        reduction in stratospheric ozone in polar regions, resulting in reduced downward transport of ozone to the troposphere (Pitari et al., 2014;
        Tilmes et al., 2018). The reduction in stratospheric ozone also allows more UV radiation to reach the surface. The reduction in surface
        ozone, together with an increase in surface UV radiation, would have important implications for crop yields but there is low confidence
        in our understanding of the net impact.

        Few studies have assessed potential SRM impacts on human health and well-being. SAI using sulphate aerosols is projected to deplete
        the ozone layer, increasing mortality from skin cancer, and SAI could increase particulate matter due to offsetting warming, reduced
        precipitation and deposition of SAI aerosols, which would increase mortality, but SAI also reduces surface-level ozone exposure, which
        would reduce mortality from air pollution, with net changes in mortality uncertain and depending on aerosol type and deployment
        scenario (Effiong and Neitzel, 2016; Eastham et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2020). However, these effects may be small compared with changes
        in risk from infectious disease (e.g., mosquito-borne illnesses) or food security due to SRM influences on climate (Carlson et al., 2020).
        Using volcanic eruptions as a natural analogue, a sudden implementation of SAI that forced the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
        system may increase risk of severe cholera outbreaks in Bengal (Trisos et al., 2018; Pinke et al., 2019). Considering only mean annual
        temperature and precipitation, SAI that stabilises global temperature at its present-day level is projected to reduce income inequality
        between countries compared with the highest warming pathway (RCP8.5) (Harding et al., 2020). Some integrated assessment model
        scenarios have included SAI (Arino et al., 2016; Emmerling and Tavoni, 2018; Heutel et al., 2018; Helwegen et al., 2019; Rickels et al.,
        2020) showing the indirect costs and benefits to welfare dominate, since the direct economic cost of SAI itself is expected to be relatively
        low (Moriyama et al., 2017; Smith and Wagner, 2018). There is a general lack of research on the wide scope of potential risk or risk

   reduction to human health, well-being and sustainable development from SRM and on their distribution across countries and vulnerable
   groups (Carlson et al., 2020; Honegger et al., 2021).

   SRM may also introduce novel risks for international collaboration and peace. Conflicting temperature preferences between countries
   may lead to counter-geoengineering measures such as deliberate release of warming agents or destruction of deployment equipment
   (Parker et al., 2018). Game-theoretic models and laboratory experiments indicate that a powerful actor or group with a higher preference
   for SRM may use SAI to cool the planet beyond what is socially optimal, imposing welfare losses on others, although this cooling does not
   necessarily imply that excluded countries would be worse off relative to a world of unmitigated warming (Ricke et al., 2013; Weitzman,
   2015; Abatayo et al., 2020). In this context, counter-geoengineering may promote international cooperation or lead to large welfare
   losses (Heyen et al., 2019; Abatayo et al., 2020).

   Cooling caused by SRM would increase the global land and ocean CO2 sinks (medium confidence), but this would not stop CO2 from                  16
   increasing in the atmosphere or affect the resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions (high confidence) (WGI
   Chapter 5).

   Few studies have assessed potential SRM impacts on ecosystems. SAI and MCB may reduce risk of coral reef bleaching compared with
   global warming with no SAI (Latham et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2015), but risks to marine life from ocean acidification would remain,
   because SRM proposals do not reduce elevated levels of anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 concentrations. MCB could cause changes in
   marine net primary productivity by reducing light availability in deployment regions, with important fishing regions off the west coast of
   South America showing both large increases and decreases in productivity (Partanen et al., 2016; Keller, 2018).

   There is large uncertainty in terrestrial ecosystem responses to SRM. By decoupling increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations
   and temperature, SAI could generate substantial impacts on large-scale biogeochemical cycles, with feedbacks to regional and global
   climate variability and change (Zarnetske et al., 2021). Compared with a high-CO2 world without SRM, global-scale SRM simulations
   indicate reducing heat stress in low latitudes would increase plant productivity, but cooling would also slow down the process of nitrogen
   mineralisation, which could decrease plant productivity (Glienke et al., 2015; Duan et al., 2020). In high-latitude and polar regions, SRM
   may limit vegetation growth compared with a high-CO2 world without SRM, but net primary productivity may still be higher than pre-
   industrial climate (Glienke et al., 2015). Tropical forests cycle more carbon and water than other terrestrial biomes, but large areas of
   the tropics may tip between savanna and tropical forest depending on rainfall and fire (Beer et al., 2010; Staver et al., 2011). Thus, SAI-
   induced reductions in precipitation in Amazonia and central Africa are expected to change the biogeography of tropical ecosystems in
   ways different from both present-day climate and global warming without SAI (Simpson et al., 2019; Zarnetske et al., 2021). This would
   have potentially large consequences for ecosystem services (Chapter 2 and Chapter 9). When designing and evaluating SAI scenarios,
   biome-specific responses need to be considered if SAI approaches are to benefit rather than harm ecosystems. Regional precipitation
   change and sea salt deposition over land from MCB may increase or decrease primary productivity in tropical rainforests (Muri et al.,
   2015). SRM that fully offsets warming could reduce the dispersal velocity required for species to track shifting temperature niches,
   whereas partially offsetting warming with SAI would not reduce this risk unless rates of warming were also reduced (Trisos et al., 2018;
   Dagon and Schrag, 2019). SAI may reduce high-fire-risk weather in Australia, Europe and parts of the Americas, compared with global
   warming without SAI (Burton et al., 2018). Yet SAI using sulphur injection could shift the spatial distribution of acid-induced aluminium
   soil toxicity into relatively undisturbed ecosystems in Europe and North America (Visioni et al., 2020). For the same amount of global
   mean cooling, SAI, MCB and CCT would have different effects on gross and net primary productivity because of different spatial patterns
   of temperature, available sunlight, and hydrological cycle changes (Duan et al., 2020). Large-scale modification of land surfaces for GBAM
   may have strong trade-offs with biodiversity and other ecosystem services, including food security (Seneviratne et al., 2018a). Although
   existing studies indicate SRM will have widespread impacts on ecosystems, risks and potential for risk reduction for marine and terrestrial
   ecosystems and biodiversity remain largely unknown.

   A sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high CO2 emissions scenario would cause rapid climate change (high confidence; WGI
   Chapter 4). More scenario analysis is needed on the potential likelihood of sudden termination (Kosugi, 2013; Irvine and Keith, 2020).
   A gradual phase-out of SRM combined with emission reduction and CDR could avoid these termination effects (medium confidence)
   (MacMartin et al., 2014; Keith and MacMartin, 2015; Tilmes et al., 2016). Several studies find that large and extremely rapid warming
   and abrupt changes to the water cycle would occur within a decade if a sudden termination of SAI occurred (McCusker et al., 2014;
   Crook et al., 2015b). The size of this ‘termination shock’ is proportional to the amount of radiative forcing being masked by SAI. A sudden
   termination of SAI could place many thousands of species at risk of extinction, because the resulting rapid warming would be too fast for
   species to track the changing climate (Trisos et al., 2018).

        Public perceptions of SRM
        Studies on the public perception of SRM have used multiple methods: questionnaire surveys, workshops, and focus group interviews
        (Burns et al., 2016; Cummings et al., 2017). Most studies have been limited to Western societies, with some exceptions. Studies have
        repeatedly found that respondents are largely unaware of SRM (Merk et al., 2015). In the context of this general lack of familiarity, the
        public prefers CDR to SRM (Pidgeon et al., 2012), is very cautious about SRM deployment because of potential environmental side effects
        and governance concerns, and mostly rejects deployment for the foreseeable future. Studies also suggest conditional and reluctant
        support for research, including proposed field experiments, with conditions of proper governance (Sugiyama et al., 2020). Recent studies
        show that the perception varies with the intensity of deliberation (Merk et al., 2019), and that the public distinguishes different funding
        sources (Nelson et al., 2021). Limited studies for developing countries show a tendency for respondents to be more open to SRM
        (Visschers et al., 2017; Sugiyama et al., 2020), perhaps because they experience climate change more directly (Carr and Yung, 2018).
        In some Anglophone countries, a small portion of the public believes in chemtrail conspiracy theories, which are easily found in social
16      media (Tingley and Wagner, 2017; Allgaier, 2019). Since researchers rarely distinguish different SRM options in engagement studies, there
        remains uncertainty in public perception.

        Ethics
        There is broad literature on ethical considerations around SRM, mainly stemming from philosophy or political theory, and mainly focused
        on SAI (Flegal et al., 2019). There is concern that publicly debating, researching and potentially deploying SAI could involve a ‘moral
        hazard’, with potential to obstruct ongoing and future mitigation efforts (Morrow, 2014; Baatz, 2016; McLaren, 2016), while empirical
        evidence is limited and mostly at the individual, not societal, level (Burns et al., 2016; Merk et al., 2016; Merk et al., 2019). There is
        low agreement whether research and outdoors experimentation will create a ‘slippery slope’ towards eventual deployment, leading
        to a lock-in to long-term SRM, or can be effectively regulated at a later stage to avoid undesirable outcomes (Hulme, 2014; Parker,
        2014; Callies, 2019; McKinnon, 2019). Regarding potential deployment of SRM, procedural, distributive and recognitional conceptions
        of justice are being explored (Svoboda and Irvine, 2014; Svoboda, 2017; Preston and Carr, 2018; Hourdequin, 2019). With the SRM
        research community’s increasing focus on distributional impacts of SAI, researchers have started more explicitly considering inequality
        in participation and inclusion of vulnerable countries and marginalised social groups (Flegal and Gupta, 2018; Whyte, 2018; Táíwò and
        Talati, 2021), including considering stopping research (Stephens and Surprise, 2020; National Academies of Sciences and Medicine,
        2021a). There is recognition that SRM research has been conducted predominantly by a relatively small number of experts in the Global
        North, and that more can be done to enable participation from diverse peoples and geographies in setting research agendas and research
        governance priorities, and undertaking research, with initial efforts to this effect (e.g., Rahman et al., 2018), noting unequal power
        relations in participation could influence SRM research governance and potential implications for policy (Whyte, 2018; Táíwò and Talati,
        2021; Winickoff et al., 2015; Frumhoff and Stephens, 2018; Biermann and Möller, 2019; McLaren and Corry, 2021; National Academies of
        Sciences and Medicine, 2021b)

        Governance of research and of deployment
        Currently, there is no dedicated, formal international SRM governance for research, development, demonstration or deployment (see
        WGIII Chapter 14). Some multilateral agreements—such as the UN Convention on Biological Diversity or the Vienna Convention on
        the Protection of the Ozone Layer—indirectly and partially cover SRM, but none is comprehensive, and the lack of robust and formal
        SRM governance poses risks (Ricke et al., 2013; Talberg et al., 2018a; Reynolds, 2019a). While governance objectives range broadly,
        from prohibition to enabling research and potentially deployment (Sugiyama et al., 2018b; Gupta et al., 2020), there is agreement that
        SRM governance should cover all interacting stages of research through to any potential, eventual deployment with rules, institutions
        and norms (Reynolds, 2019b). Accordingly, governance arrangements are co-evolving with respective SRM technologies across the
        interacting stages of research, development, demonstration and—potentially—deployment (Rayner et al., 2013; Parker, 2014; Parson,
        2014). Stakeholders are developing governance already in outdoors research, for example for MCB and OAC experiments on the Great
        Barrier Reef (McDonald et al., 2019). Co-evolution of governance and SRM research provides a chance for responsibly developing SRM
        technologies with broader public participation and political legitimacy, guarding against potential risks and harms relevant across a full
        range of scenarios, and ensuring that SRM is considered only as a part of a broader portfolio of responses to climate change (Stilgoe,
        2015; Nicholson et al., 2018). For SAI, large-scale outdoor experiments even with low radiative forcing could be transboundary, and
        those with deployment-scale radiative forcing may not be distinguished from deployment, such that MacMartin and Kravitz (2019)
        argue for continued reliance on modelling until a decision on whether and how to deploy is made, with modelling helping governance
        development. For further discussion of SRM governance, see Chapter 14, WGIII.

     events: risks/impacts to human health, livelihoods, assets and ecosystems from extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and associated wildfires, and
     coastal flooding. RFC3 Distribution of impacts: risks/impacts that disproportionately affect particular groups owing to uneven distribution of physical climate change hazards,
     exposure or vulnerability. RFC4 Global aggregate impacts: impacts to socio-ecological systems that can be aggregated globally into a single metric, such as monetary damages,
     lives affected, species lost or ecosystem degradation at a global scale. RFC5 Large-scale singular events: relatively large, abrupt and sometimes irreversible changes in systems
     caused by global warming, such as ice sheet disintegration or thermohaline circulation slowing. Comparison of the increase of risk across RFCs indicates the relative sensitivity of

   (France), Franziska Piontek (Germany)

   This Cross-Working Group Box assesses literature estimating the potential global aggregate economic costs of climate change and the
   social cost of carbon (SCC), where the former are sometimes referred to as estimates of global ‘climate damages’ and the latter are
   estimates of the potential monetised impacts to society of an additional metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere. These
   measures include the economic costs of climate change that could be felt in market sectors such as agriculture, energy services, labour
   productivity and coastal resources, as well as non-market impacts such as other types of human health risks (including mortality effects)
   and ecosystems. Global economic impacts estimates can inform decisions about global climate management strategy, while SCC estimates
   can inform globally incremental emissions decisions. In practice, economic damage estimates have been used to explore economically
   efficient (‘economically optimal’) global emissions pathways (e.g., Nordhaus and Moffat, 2017), while SCCs have been used to inform
   federal and state-level policy assessment in some countries (Greenstone et al., 2013; Rose and Bistline, 2016), but the type of SCC and          16
   application matters (Rose, 2017). This literature has been assessed in previous WGII reports (e.g., Arent et al., 2014), and this box serves
   this need for this report. The assessment in this box was performed jointly across WGII and WGIII, building on the foundation of WGII AR6
   Chapter 16’s ‘Risk to living standards’ assessment (Section 16.5.2.3.4), which includes consideration of severe risks to global aggregate
   economic output, and WGIII AR6 Chapter 3’s assessment of the benefits of mitigation. It also informs Chapter 16’s global aggregate
   impacts Reasons for Concern and supports Chapter 18’s assessment of global emissions transitions, risk management and climate resilient
   development. In keeping with the broad risk framing presented in Chapter 1 of this report, other lines of evidence regarding climate risks,
   beyond monetary estimates, should be considered in decision making, including key risks and Reasons for Concern.

   Methods for estimating global economic costs of climate impacts
   There are several broad approaches to estimating climate damages, including biophysical process models, structural economic models,
   statistical methods (also called empirical or econometric) and hybrid approaches, with each methodology having strengths and
   weaknesses. Process models simulate physical, natural science and/or engineering processes and their response to climate variables,
   which are then monetised (e.g., Anthoff and Tol, 2014; Sieg et al., 2019; Narita et al., 2020). Process approaches have the advantage
   of being explicit and interpretable, though they can be computationally intensive; may omit relevant impact channels, interactions and
   market dynamics affecting valuation; and often lack a rigorous empirical basis for calibration (Fisher-Vanden et al.). Structural economic
   modelling represents climate impacts on inputs, production, household consumption, aggregate investment, and markets for economic
   sectors and regional economies (e.g., Reilly et al., 2007; Roson and Van der Mensbrugghe, 2012; Anthoff and Tol, 2014; Dellink et al., 2019;
   Takakura et al., 2019), often using computable general equilibrium (CGE) frameworks. Structural models can evaluate how market and
   non-market impacts might enter and transmit through economies, and adaptation responses within input and output markets, consumer
   and investment choices, and inter-regional trade (e.g., Darwin and Tol, 2001; Dellink et al., 2019; Takakura et al., 2019). Statistical
   methods estimate economic impacts in a given sector (e.g., Auffhammer, 2018) or in aggregate (e.g., Dell et al., 2014; Burke et al., 2015;
   Hsiang et al., 2017; Pretis et al., 2018; Kahn et al., 2019), inferred from observed changes in economic factors, weather and climate, with
   responses and net results constrained by available data. Since AR5, hybrid approaches have taken different forms to integrate process,
   statistical and/or structural methods, and represent a potentially promising means of leveraging the strengths of different approaches
   (e.g., Moore and Diaz, 2015; and Hsiang et al., 2017; Moore et al., 2017a; Ricke et al., 2018; Yumashev et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020b).
   There is also a small literature that uses expert elicitation to gather subjective assessments of climate risks and potential economic
   impacts (Nordhaus, 1994; IPCC, 2019a; Pindyck, 2019).

   In addition to differences in methods, there are also differences in scope—geographic, sectoral and temporal. Global estimates are
   frequently based on an aggregation of independent sector and/or regional modelling and estimates; however, there are examples of
   estimates from global modelling that simulate multiple types of climate impacts and their potential interactions within a single, coherent
   framework (e.g., Roson and Van der Mensbrugghe, 2012; Dellink et al., 2019; Takakura et al., 2019). Differences in scope also represent
   strengths and weaknesses between the methodologies, with narrower scope allowing for more detailed assessment, but missing potential
   interactions with the scope not covered (e.g., other geographic areas, sectors, markets or periods of time).

   Comprehensive economic estimates are challenging to produce for many reasons, including complex interactions among physical, natural
   and social systems; pervasive climate, socioeconomic and system response uncertainties; and the heterogeneous nature of climate
   impacts that vary across space and time. Critiques and commentaries of global estimation methods (Pindyck, 2013; Stern, 2013; van
   den Bergh and Botzen, 2015; Cropper et al., 2017; Diaz and Moore, 2017; Pindyck, 2017; Rose et al., 2017; Stoerk et al., 2018; DeFries
   et al., 2019; Pezzey, 2019; Calel et al., 2020; Warner et al., 2020; EPRI, 2021; Grubb et al., 2021; Newell et al., 2021) include, among
   other things, concerns about statistical methods estimating weather but not climate relationships, making out-of-sample extrapolations,

        and model specification uncertainty, concerns about the observational grounding of structural modelling, and overall concerns about
        the lack of adaptation consideration, as well as representation and evaluation of potential large-scale singular events such as ice
        sheet destabilisation or biodiversity destruction, some questioning the ability to generate robust estimates (i.e., estimates insensitive
        to reasonable alternative inputs and specifications), and general concerns about methodological details, transparency and justification.

        Additional methodological challenges to address (see, for instance, EPRI, 2021; Piontek et al., 2021) include how to capture and represent
        uncertainty and variability in potential damage responses for a given climate and societal condition, combine estimates from different methods
        and sources (including aggregating independent sectoral and regional results), assess sensitivity and evaluate robustness of estimates
        (including sensitivity to model specification), capture interactions and spillovers between regions and sectors, estimate societal welfare
        implications (versus gross domestic product [GDP] changes) of market and non-market impacts, consider distributional effects, represent
        micro- and macro-adaptation processes (and adaptation costs), specify non-gradual damages and nonlinearities, and improve understanding
16      of potential long-run economic growth effects. Note that the treatment of time preference, risk aversion and equity considerations have
        important welfare implications for the aggregation of both potential economic impacts and climate change mitigation costs.

        In addition to updated and new methods and estimates, newer literature has explored non-gradual damages, such as climatic and
        socioeconomic tipping points (Lontzek et al., 2015; Méjean et al., 2020), potential damage to economic growth (e.g., Burke et al., 2015;
        Moore and Diaz, 2015), valuing uncertainty in potential damages (Jensen and Traeger, 2014; Lemoine and Traeger, 2016; Cai and Lontzek)
        and representing adaptation (Takakura et al., 2019; Carleton et al., 2020; Rode et al., 2021). Going forward, to help advance science
        and decisions, a key research priority is to understand and evaluate methodological strengths and weaknesses in damage estimation,
        and reconcile the differences affecting comparability in such a way that it informs use of the different lines of evidence. This will require
        greater transparency and assessment of details and assumptions in individual methods, communication and evaluation of alternatives
        for specifying or calibrating climate damage functional representations with respect to climate and non-climate drivers and potential
        nonlinearities, including evaluating data sufficiency for levels within and beyond observations and for characterising physical system
        dynamics, and evaluating the sensitivity of results to model specification and input parameter choices (Cropper et al., 2017). Improving
        the robustness of economic impact estimates is an active area of research. Below we describe the latest estimates.

        Global estimates of the economic costs of climate impacts
        Since AR5, many new estimates of the global economic costs of climate change have been produced. Figure Cross-Working Group
        Box ECONOMIC.1 shows a wide spread of estimates, with growing variance at higher levels of warming, both within and across
        methodology types (i.e., statistical, structural or meta-analysis). Meta-analysis is used here to refer to studies that treat other studies’
        estimates as data points in an attempt to derive a synthesised functional form.

        Global aggregate economic impact estimates (Figure Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC.1) are generally found to increase with
        global average temperature change, as well as vary by other drivers, such as income and population and the composition of the economy.
        Most estimates are nonlinear with higher marginal economic impacts at higher temperature, although some recover declining marginal
        economic impacts, and functional forms cannot be determined for all studies. The drivers of nonlinearity found in economic impact
        estimates, and the differences in nonlinearity across estimates (e.g., convex versus concave, degree of curvature), are not well understood,
        with methodology construction, assumptions and data all being potential factors. Relative to AR5, there have been more estimates and
        greater variation in estimates, including some recent estimates significantly higher than the range reported in AR5. For most of the
        studies shown in Figure Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC.1, the visible variation within a study represents alternative socioeconomic
        projections and climate modelling, not economic impacts response uncertainty for a given socioeconomic and climate condition. Response
        uncertainty could be significant, as indicated by some of the results shown in the figure (e.g., Burke et al., 2015; Rose et al., 2017), but
        methodological differences in how uncertainty is characterised (model specification, errors and confidence intervals versus distributions
        of results) limit comparability and assessment. Note that modelling factors between global temperature change and the economic impact
        calculation, such as regional temperature pattern assumptions or assumed SLR dynamics, can also impact calculated estimates (e.g.,
        Warren et al.., 2021 PAGE09 estimates versus those in Rose et al.., 2017, Chen et al.., 2020 PAGE-ICE estimates versus Burke et al.., 2015).

        From Figure Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC.1, we find a large span of damage estimates, even without considering uncertainty/
        confidence in damage responses, including for today’s level of warming (about 1°C). There is also evidence that some regions benefit
        from low levels of warming, leading to net benefits globally at these temperatures. The size of the span of estimates grows with global
        warming level, with variation across statistical estimates larger than variation in structural estimates. The structural and meta-analyses
        estimates appear to be in closer agreement, but that outcome is contingent on the meta-analyses’ data considerations and approach.
        Meta analyses to date have not assessed the alternative methods and dealt with the lack of comparability between methods.

   Figure Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC.1 | Global aggregate economic impact estimates by global warming level (annual % global GDP loss
   relative to GDP without additional climate change). Top row panels present estimates by methodology type: (a) statistical modelling, (b) structural modelling and
   (c) meta-analyses, with all estimates from a paper in the same colour and estimates from methodologies other than that highlighted by the panel in grey for reference.
   Second row left panel (d) presents AR5 estimates. Second row right panel (e) presents all estimates in one figure, with the same colours as panels (a–d) using outlined
   dots for the statistical modelling estimates, solid dots for structural modelling estimates, and triangles for meta-analysis estimates. In all panels, lines represent functions,
   with dashed and dotted lines 5th and 95th percentile functions from structural modelling. To avoid duplication, estimates from papers using the economic impacts
   estimates or model formulations already represented in the figure are not included (e.g., Diaz and Moore, 2017; Chen et al., 2020b; Glanemann et al., 2020; Warren et al.,
   2021). The exception is Burke et al. (2018), with the different estimates shown representing variation across climate scenarios for a given aggregate economic impacts
   specification from Burke et al. (2015)—the ‘pooled, short run’ statistical specification. Results shown for the latter are estimates with the author’s different statistical
   model specifications (and a fixed climate scenario, SSP5). From top to bottom, the Burke et al. (2015) estimates are for the ‘pooled, long run’, ‘differentiated, long run’,
   ‘pooled, short run’ (authors’ base case) and ‘differentiated, short run’ statistical specifications. For Howard and Sterner (2017), the authors’ preferred function is shown.
   Overall, estimates shown in the figure can correspond to different future years, reflecting different socioeconomic conditions and climate pathways to a global warming
   level. Global average temperature change bars relative to the period 1850–1900 are shown below the economic cost estimates to provide context to potential future
   warming. Shown are the WGI AR6 assessed best estimates and 90% intervals for the illustrative emissions scenarios considered for the near term 2021–2040, mid-term

        Differences in methodology type and scope complicate comparison, assessment and synthesis (Cropper et al., 2017; Diaz and Moore,
        2017; EPRI, 2021; Piontek et al., 2021). In particular, structural economic modelling and empirical aggregate output modelling are
        fundamentally different, which has been identified as an issue affecting the comparability of results (Cropper et al., 2017). The different
        methodologies affect outcomes, with global aggregate estimates based on statistical methodologies typically higher than those from
        structural modelling (Figure Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC.1). This is, in part, due to the relationships in observational data
        captured by statistical modelling, assumed persistence of impacts in statistical modelling, broader adaptation responses in structural
        modelling, and differences in the representation of future societies and how they might evolve, respond and interact. Within statistical
        modelling, results are also found to be very sensitive to the statistical model specification (e.g., Burke et al., 2015; Newell et al., 2021).
        Within structural modelling, differences in representations of biophysical changes and economic structural dynamics contribute to
        differences across structural estimates (e.g., Rose et al., 2017).

16      The wide range of estimates, and the lack of comparability between methodologies, does not allow for identification of a robust range
        of estimates with confidence (high confidence). Evaluating and reconciling differences in methodologies is a research priority for
        facilitating use of the different lines of evidence (high confidence). However, the existence of higher estimates than AR5 indicate that
        global aggregate economic impacts could be higher than previously estimated (low confidence due to the lack of comparability across
        methodologies and robustness of estimates).

        While Figure Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC.1 summarises global aggregate estimates, the literature exhibits significant
        heterogeneity in regional economic impacts that are also sensitive to methodology, model specification and societal assumptions (with, for
        instance, larger estimates due to the assumed size of society, but offsetting adaptive capacity improvements and adaptation responses).
        Regional results illustrate the potential for overall net benefits in more temperate regions at lower levels of warming with potential lower
        energy demand and comparative advantages in agricultural markets; however, at higher levels of warming, net losses are estimated. In
        addition, economic impacts for poorer households and poorer countries represent a smaller share in aggregate quantifications expressed
        in GDP terms than their influence on well-being or welfare (Byers et al., 2018; Hallegatte et al., 2020).

        Social cost of carbon methods and estimates
        The global economic impact estimates discussed in the previous section serve as a key input into the calculation of the value of potential
        net damages caused by a marginal ton of carbon dioxide emissions, or the SCC. To compute an SCC, damage estimates are commonly
        combined in a multi-century modelling framework with socioeconomic and emissions projections, a physical model of the climate,
        including a SLR component, and assumptions about the discount rate, with current frameworks having highly stylised representations of
        these components. Though we do not present quantitative estimates here, due to the challenge of comparability, for economic impacts
        methodologies (as discussed above) as well as other SCC estimation elements, large variations in SCC estimates are found in the
        literature assessed due to, among other things, differences in modelling component representations, input and parameter assumptions,
        considerations of uncertainty, and discounting, inflation, and emissions year (e.g., Tol, 2009; Tol, 2018; Pezzey, 2019; Iese et al., 2021).
        There are also different ‘variants’ of SCC estimates that differ conceptually, and in magnitude, depending on the reference condition for
        evaluating the impact of a marginal metric ton—is it being evaluated relative to a no-climate-policy baseline, an economically efficient
        pathway that weighs the benefits and costs of emissions mitigation, or a pathway based on a particular climate policy or goal such as
        2°C or a concentration target (Rose et al., 2017)? The variant of SCC has implications for its applicability to different policy contexts (Rose
        and Bistline, 2016).

        In addition to the economic impacts methodological challenges discussed above with respect to aggregate economic impact estimates,
        the additional components needed for SCC calculations give rise to a new set of technical issues and critiques, including incorporation
        of uncertainties in the components beyond climate damages, links between components, and discounting (van den Bergh and Botzen,
        2015; Cropper et al., 2017; Diaz and Moore, 2017; Pindyck, 2017; Rose et al., 2017; EPRI, 2021). For component-specific discussions and
        assessment, see Cropper et al. (2017), Rose et al. (2017) and EPRI (2021).

        Substantial progress has been made in recent years to better reflect complexities in the global economy, the climate system, and their
        interaction. For example, recent studies have explored damages to natural capital (Bastien-Olvera and Moore, 2021), the influence of
        imperfect substitutability between environmental services and market goods (Sterner and Persson, 2008; Weitzman, 2012; Drupp and
        Hänsel, 2021), the implications of heterogeneous climate change impacts across income groups (Dennig et al., 2015; EPRI, 2021; Errickson
        et al., 2021), the potential for persistent climate impacts to economic growth instead of effects on levels of economic output (Dietz and
        Stern, 2015; Moore and Diaz, 2015; Ricke et al., 2018; Kikstra et al., 2021; Newell et al., 2021), valuing the risks of climate tipping points
        (Cai and Lontzek, 2019; Rising et al., 2020), valuing uncertainty under risk aversion (Jensen and Traeger, 2014; Lemoine and Traeger,

    2016), and modelling a distinction between intertemporal inequality aversion and risk aversion in the social welfare utility function (Crost
    and Traeger, 2013; Jensen and Traeger, 2014; Daniel et al., 2015). These new studies have, in general, raised estimates of the SCC (Crost
    and Traeger, 2013; Jensen and Traeger, 2014; Gerlagh and Michielsen, 2015; Moore and Diaz, 2015; Faulwasser et al., 2018; Guivarch and
    Pottier, 2018; Budolfson et al., 2019; Cai and Lontzek, 2019; Dietz and Venmans, 2019; Kalkuhl and Wenz, 2020), in some cases by an
    order of magnitude (Ricke et al., 2018). However, challenges persist in terms of moving from conceptual to practical application, such as
    pinning down parameter specifications, modelling specific mechanisms for impacts, and more fully representing adaptation.

    Despite these scientific advances, SCC estimates vary widely in the literature. Technical issues with past and current modelling (e.g.,
    Pezzey, 2019; Pindyck, 2019; EPRI, 2021) and the challenge of comparability across methodologies imply that many estimates are not
    robust (high confidence). Also, as a result, the issue of directional bias of past estimates remains unsettled. Better representation of
    uncertainty in methods can improve robustness, while detailed methodology assessment and comparison will help define the relative
    biases of methods (high confidence).                                                                                                                16
    Application to decision making
    The literature has also assessed the application of aggregate economic impact cost and SCC estimates (Rose and Bistline, 2016; Rose
    et al., 2017; Kaufman et al., 2020) and identified conceptual and technical issues that need to be considered when using results to inform
    policy decisions. These issues include: accounting for endogenous marginal benefits and socioeconomic conditions in evaluating policies
    with non-incremental global emissions implications; consistency in assumptions and treatment of uncertainty across benefit and cost
    calculations; fully accounting for the streams of both mitigation costs and benefits over time; avoiding inefficiently valuing or pricing
    emissions more than once across policies and jurisdictions; and accounting for emissions leakage to capture net climate implications.
    Furthermore, concerns about the robustness of estimates have led some to recommend considering alternatives, such as using marginal
    mitigation cost estimates based on modelling of policy goals instead of the SCC (e.g., Rose, 2012; Pezzey, 2019; Kaufman et al., 2020),
    although this comes with its own set of assumptions and technical challenges.

         Frequently Asked Questions


         FAQ 16.1 | What are key risks in relation to climate change?
         A few clusters of key risks can be identified which have the potential to become particularly severe and pose significant challenges for
         adaptation worldwide. These risks, therefore, deserve special attention. They include risks to important resources such as food and water, risks
         to critical infrastructures, economies, health and peace, as well as risks to threatened ecosystems and coastal areas.

         The IPCC defines key risks related to climate change as potentially severe risks that are relevant to the primary goal
         of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty to avoid ‘dangerous human interference
         with the climate system’, and whatever the scale considered (global to local). What constitutes ‘dangerous’ or
         ‘severe’ risks is partly a value judgement and can therefore vary widely across people, communities or countries.
         However, the severity of risks also depends on criteria like the magnitude, irreversibility, timing, likelihood of the
         impacts they describe, and the adaptive capacity of the affected systems (species or societies). The Working Group
16       II authors use these criteria in various ways to identify those risks that could become especially large in the future
         owing to the interaction of physical changes to the climate system with vulnerable populations and ecosystems
         exposed to them. For example, some natural systems may be at risk of collapsing, as is the case for warm-water
         coral reefs by mid-century, even if global warming is limited to +1.5°C. For human systems, severe risks can include
         increasing restriction of water resources that are already being observed; mortality or economic damages that are
         large compared with historical crises; or impacts on coastal systems from SLR and storms that could make some
         locations uninhabitable.

         More than 120 key risks across sectors and regions have been identified by the chapters of this report, which have
         then been clustered into a set of 8 overarching risks, called representative key risks, which can occur from global
         to local scales but are of potential significance for a wide diversity of regions and systems globally. As shown
         in Figure FAQ16.1.1, the representative key risks include risks to (a) low-lying coastal areas, (b) terrestrial and
         marine ecosystems, (c) critical infrastructures and networks, (d) living standards, (e) human health, (f) food security,
         (g) water security and (h) peace and human mobility.

         These representative key risks are expected to increase in the coming decades and will depend strongly not only
         on how much climate change occurs, but also on how the exposure and vulnerability of society changes, as well
         as on the extent to which adaptation efforts will be effective enough to substantially reduce the magnitude of
         severe risks. The report finds that risks are highest when high warming combines with development pathways with
         continued high levels of poverty and inequality, poor health systems, lack of capacity to invest in infrastructure,
         and other characteristics making societies highly vulnerable. Some regions already have high levels of exposure and
         vulnerability, such as in many developing countries as well as communities in small islands, Arctic areas and high
         mountains; in these regions, even low levels of warming will contribute to severe risks in the coming decades. Some
         risks in industrialised countries could also become severe over the course of this century, for example if climate
         change affects critical infrastructure such as transport hubs, power plants or financial centres. In some cases, such
         as coral reef environments and areas already severely affected by intense extreme events (e.g., recent typhoons or
         wildfires), climate risks are already considered severe.

         Frequently Asked Questions


         FAQ 16.2 | How does adaptation help to manage key risks and what are its limits?
         Adaptation helps to manage key risks by reducing vulnerability or exposure to climate hazards. However, constraining factors make it harder to
         plan or implement adaptation and result in adaptation limits beyond which risks cannot be prevented. Limits to adaptation are already being
         experienced, for instance by coastal communities, small-scale farmers and some natural systems.

         Adaptation-related responses are actions that are taken with the intention of managing risks by reducing
         vulnerability or exposure to climate hazards. While mitigation responses aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
         and slow warming, adaptations respond to the impacts and risks that are unavoidable, either due to past emissions
         or failure to reduce emissions. However, while these responses intend to reduce risks, it is difficult to determine
         precise levels of risk reduction that can be attributed to adaptation. Changing levels of risk as well as other actions—
         such as economic development—make it challenging to definitively connect specific levels of risk reduction with
16       adaptation. Although it is not feasible to assess the adequacy of adaptation for risk reduction at global or regional
         levels, evidence from specific localised adaptation projects do show that adaptation-related responses reduce
         risk. Moreover, many adaptation measures offer near-term co-benefits related to mitigation and to sustainable
         development, including enhancing food security and reducing poverty.

         Adaptation responses can occur in natural systems without the intervention of humans, such as species shifting their
         range, time of breeding, or migration behaviour. Humans can also assist adaptation in natural systems through,
         for example, conservation activities such as species regeneration projects or protecting ecosystem services. Other
         adaptation-related responses by humans aim to reduce risk by decreasing vulnerability and/or exposure of people
         to climate hazards. This includes infrastructural projects (e.g., upgrading water systems to improve flood control),
         technological innovation (e.g., early-warning systems for extreme events), behavioural change (e.g., shift to new
         crop types or livelihood strategies), cultural shifts (e.g., changing perspectives on urban greenspace, or increased
         recognition of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge) and institutional governance (e.g., adaptation
         planning, funding and legislation).

         While adaptation is important to reduce risk, adaptation cannot prevent all climate impacts from occurring.
         Adaptation has soft and hard limits, points at which adaptive actions are unable to prevent risks. Soft limits can
         change over time as additional adaptation options become available, while hard limits will not change as there are
         no additional adaptive actions that are possible. Soft limits occur largely due to constraints—factors that make it
         harder to plan and implement adaptation, such as lack of financial resources or insufficient human capacity. Across
         regions and sectors, the most challenging constraints to adaptation are financial and those related to governance,
         institutions and policy measures. Limited funding and ineffective governance structures make it difficult to plan
         and implement adaptation-related responses which can lead to insufficient adaptation to prevent risks. Small-scale
         farmers and coastal communities are already facing soft limits to adaptation as measures that they have put in
         place are not enough to prevent loss. If constraints that are limiting adaptation are addressed, then additional
         adaptation can take place and these soft limits can be overcome. Evidence on limits to adaptation is largely focused
         on terrestrial and aquatic species and ecosystems, coastal communities, water security, agricultural production, and
         human health and heat.

         Adaptation is critical for responding to unavoidable climate risks. Greater warming will mean more and more
         severe impacts requiring a high level of adaptation which may face greater constraints and reach soft and hard
         limits. At high levels of warming, it may not be possible to adapt to some severe impacts.

    Frequently Asked Questions


    FAQ 16.3 | How do climate scientists differentiate between impacts of climate change and changes in natural or
    human systems that occur for other reasons?
    We can already observe many impacts of climate change today. The large body of climatic impact data and research confirms this. To decide
    whether an observed change in a natural or human system is at least partly an impact of climate change, we systematically compare the
    observed situation with a theoretical situation without observed levels of climate change. This is detection and attribution research.

    Global mean temperature has already risen by more than 1°C, and that also means that the impacts of climate change
    become more visible. Many natural and human systems are sensitive to weather conditions. Crop yields, river floods
    and associated damages, ecosystems such as coral reefs, or the extent of wildfires are affected by temperatures
    and precipitation changes. Other factors also come into play. So, for example, crop yields around the world have
    increased over the last decades because of increasing fertilizer input, improved management and varieties. How do
    we detect the effect of climate change itself on these systems, when the other factors are excluded? This question                             16
    is central for impact attribution. ‘Impact of climate change’ is defined as the difference between the observed
    state of the system (e.g., level of crop yields, damage induced by a river flood, coral bleaching) and the state of the
    system assuming the same observed levels of non-climate-related drivers (e.g., fertilizer input, land use patterns or
    settlement structures) but no climate change.

    So:

    ‘Impact of climate change’ is defined as the difference between the observed state of the system and the state of
    the system assuming the same observed levels of non-climate-related drivers but no climate change. For example,
    we can compare the level of crop yields, damage induced by a river flood, and coral bleaching with differences
    in fertilizer input, land use patterns or settlement structures, without climate change and with climate change
    occurring.

    While this definition is quite clear, there certainly is the problem that, in real life, we do not have a ‘no climate
    change world’ to compare with. We use model simulations where the influence of climate change can be eliminated
    to estimate what might have happened without climate change. In a situation where the influence of other
    non-climate-related drivers is known to be minor (e.g., in very remote locations), the non-climate-change situation
    can also be approximated by observation from an early period where climate change was still minor. Often, a
    combination of different approaches increases our confidence in the quantification of the impact of climate change.

    Impacts of climate change have been identified in a wide range of natural, human and managed systems. For
    example, climate change is the major driver of observed widespread shifts in the timing of events in the annual
    cycle of marine and terrestrial species, and climate change has increased the extent of areas burned by wildfires
    in certain regions, increased heat-related mortality, and had an impact on the expansion of vector-borne diseases.

    In some other cases, research has made considerable progress in identifying the sensitivity of certain processes
    to weather conditions without yet attributing observed changes to long-term climate change. Two examples of
    weather sensitivity without attribution are observed crop price fluctuations and waterborne diseases.

    Finally, it is important to note that ‘attribution to climate change’ does not necessarily mean ‘attribution to
    anthropogenic climate change’. Instead, according to the IPCC definition, climate change means any long-term
    change in the climate system, no matter where it comes from.

         Frequently Asked Questions


         FAQ 16.4 | What adaptation-related responses to climate change have already been observed, and do they help
         reduce climate risk?
         Adaptation-related responses are the actions taken with the intention of managing risks by reducing vulnerability or exposure to climate
         hazards. Responses are increasing and expanding across global regions and sectors, although there is still a lot of opportunity for improvement.
         Examining the adequacy and effectiveness of the responses is important to guide planning, implementation and expansion.

         The most frequently reported adaptation-related responses are behavioural changes made by individuals
         and households in response to drought, flooding and rainfall variability in Africa and Asia. Governments are
         increasingly undertaking planning, and implementing policy and legislation, including, for example, new zoning
         regulations and building codes, coordination mechanisms, disaster and emergency planning, or extension services
         to support farmer uptake of drought tolerant crops. Local governments are particularly active in adaptation-related
16       responses, particularly in protecting infrastructure and services, such as water and sanitation. Across all regions,
         adaptation-related responses are strongly linked to food security, with poverty alleviation a key strategy in the
         Global South.

         Overall, however, the extent of adaptation-related responses globally is low. On average, responses tend to be
         local, incremental, fragmented, and consistent with Business-As-Usual practices. There are no global regions or
         sectors where the overall adaptation-related response has been rapid, widespread, substantial and has overcome or
         challenged key barriers. The extent of adaptation thus remains low globally, with significant potential for increased
         scope, depth, speed and the challenging of adaptation limits. Examples of low-extent adaptations include shifts by
         subsistence farmers in crop variety or timing, household flood barriers to protect houses and gardens, and harvesting
         of water for home and farm use. In contrast, high-extent adaptation means that responses are widespread and
         coordinated, involve major shifts from normal practices, are rapid, and challenge existing constraints to adaptation.
         Examples of high-extent adaptations include planned relocation of populations away from increasingly flood-prone
         areas, and widely implemented social support to communities to prevent migration or displacement due to climate
         hazards.

         Increasing the extent of adaptation-related responses will require more widespread implementation and
         coordination, more novel and radical shifts from Business-As-Usual practices, more rapid transitions, and challenging
         or surmounting limits—key barriers—to adaptation. This might include, for example, best-practice programmes
         implemented in a few communities being expanded to a larger region or country, accelerated implementation of
         behaviours or regulatory frameworks, coordination mechanisms to support deep structural reform within and across
         governments, and strategic planning that challenges fundamental norms and underlying constraints to change.

         We have very little information on whether existing adaptation-related responses that have already been
         implemented are reducing climate risks. There is evidence that risks due to extreme heat and flooding have
         declined, though it is not clear if these are due to specific adaptation-related responses or general and incremental
         socioeconomic development. It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of adaptation-related responses, and even
         more difficult to know whether responses are adequate to adapt to rising climate risk. These remain unknown but
         important questions in guiding implementation and expansion of adaptation-related responses.

    Frequently Asked Questions


    FAQ 16.5 | How does climate risk vary with temperature?
    Climate risk is a complex issue, and communicating it is fraught with difficulties. Risk generally increases with global warming, though it depends
    on a combination of many factors such as exposure, vulnerability and response. To present scientific findings succinctly, a risk variation diagram
    can help visualise the relationship between warming level and risk. The diagram can be useful in communicating the change in risk with warming
    for different types of risk across sectors and regions, as well as for five categories of global aggregate risk called ‘Reasons for Concern’.

    A picture speaks a thousand words. The use of images to share ideas and information to convey scientific
    understanding is an inclusive approach for communicating complex ideas. A risk variation diagram is a simple way
    to present the risk levels that have been evaluated for any particular system. These diagrams take the form of bar
    charts where each bar represents a different category of risk. The traffic light colour system is used as a basis for
    doing the risks, making it universally understandable. These diagrams are known colloquially as ‘burning ember’
    diagrams, and have been a cornerstone of IPCC assessments since the Third Assessment Report, and further developed                                                            16
    and updated in subsequent reports. The fact that the diagrams are designed to be simple, intuitive and easily
    understood with the caption alone has contributed to their longstanding effectiveness. Here, in Figure FAQ16.5.1
    below, we provide a simplified figure of this chapter’s burning embers for five categories of global aggregate risk,
    called Reasons for Concern (RFCs), which collectively synthesise how global risk changes with temperature. The
    diagram shows the levels of concern that scientists have about the consequences of climate change (for a specified
    risk category and scope), and how this relates to the level of temperature rise.

         started (i.e., average temperatures for the pre-industrial period of 1850–1900). This area of the ember appears
         white, which indicates no to negligible impacts due to climate change. Moving up the ember bar, changing colours
         show the increase in risk as the Earth warms globally in terms of degrees Celsius—yellow for moderate risk, red
         for high risk, and purple for very high risk. Definitions of the risk levels are presented in Figure FAQ16.5.1 The risk
         transitions are informed by the latest literature and scientific evidence, and developed through consultation and
         development of consensus among experts. The bars depict an averaged assessment across the world, which has the
         disadvantage of hiding regional variation. For example, some locations or regions could face high risk even when
         the global risk level is moderate.

         When the embers for different risk categories are placed next to each other, it is possible to compare risk levels at
         different levels of global warming. For example, at 1°C warming all embers appear yellow or white, so it is possible
         to say that keeping global warming below that particular temperature would help ensure risks remain moderate
16       for all five categories of concern assessed. In contrast, at 2°C warming, risk levels have transitioned to high for all
         categories assessed, and even reach a very high level of risk in the case of unique and threatened systems.



         Frequently Asked Questions


         FAQ 16.6 | What is the role of extreme weather events in the risks we face from climate change?
         Climate change has often been perceived as a slow and gradual process, but by now it is abundantly clear that many of its impacts arise through
         shocks, such as extreme weather events. Many places are facing more frequent and intense extremes, and also more surprises. The impact of
         such shocks is shaped by exposure and vulnerability, where we live, and how we are prepared for and able to cope with shocks and surprises.

         The rising risk of extreme events is one of the major RFCs about climate change. It is clear that this risk has already
         increased today. Many recent disasters already have a fingerprint of climate change.

         There are large differences in such risks from country to country, place to place, and person to person. This is of
         course partly due to differences in hazards such as heatwaves, floods, droughts, storms, storm surges, etc., and the
         way those hazards are influenced by climate change. However, an even more important aspect is people’s exposure
         and vulnerability: do these hazards occur in places where people live and work, and how badly do they affect
         people’s lives and livelihoods? Some groups are especially vulnerable, for instance elderly in the case of heatwaves,
         or people with disabilities in the case of floods. In general, poor and marginalised people tend to be much more
         affected than rich people, partly because they have fewer reserves and support systems that help them to prepare
         for, cope with and recover from a shock. On the other hand, absolute economic losses are generally higher in richer
         places, simply because more assets are at risk there.

         Many problems caused by extreme weather do not just appear because of one weather extreme, but due to a
         combination of several events. For instance, dryness may increase the risk of a subsequent heatwave. But the
         increased risk may also cascade through human systems, for instance when several consecutive disasters erode
         people’s savings, or when a heatwave reduces the ability of power plants to produce electricity, which subsequently
         affects availability of electricity to turn on air conditioning to cope with the heat. Many shocks also have impacts
         beyond the place where they occur, for instance when a failed harvest affects food prices elsewhere. Climate risks
         can also be aggravated by other shocks, such as in the case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which not
         only had a direct health impact, but also affected livelihoods around the world and left many people much more
         vulnerable to weather extremes.

         Understanding the risks we face can help in planning for the future. This may be a combination of short-term
         preparation, such as early-warning systems, and longer-term strategies to reduce vulnerability, for instance through
         urban planning, as well as reducing greenhouse gases to avoid longer-term increases in risk. Many interventions to
         increase people’s resilience are effective in the face of a range of shocks. For instance, social safety nets can help
         mitigate the impact of a drought on farmers’ livelihoods, but also of the economic impacts of COVID-19.

         Climate-related shocks are threats to society, but they can also offer opportunities for learning and change. Recent
         disasters can motivate action during a short window of opportunity when awareness of the risks is higher and policy
         attention is focused on solutions to adapt and reduce risk. However, those windows tend to be short, and attention is
         often directed at the event that was recently experienced, rather than resilience in the face of a wider range of risks.
